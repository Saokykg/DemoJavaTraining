  description: |-
    Solr is an open-source search platform that allows you to easily create and manage search applications. It is built on top of Apache Lucene, a powerful and high-performance Java search engine library.

    Solr 8.11 provides a RESTful API that allows developers to interact with Solr using standard HTTP requests. One way to interact with the Solr API is through Swagger UI, a graphical interface that allows you to explore and test the Solr API.
    
    The Solr 8.11 Swagger API provides documentation for the Solr REST API, allowing developers to easily understand and use the API. The API is organized by resource and method, and each resource and method is described with detailed documentation, including input parameters, output formats, and examples.
    
    With the Solr 8.11 Swagger API, developers can quickly build powerful search applications that can search, index, and analyze large amounts of data with ease. The API also provides advanced features such as faceting, highlighting, and spatial search, making it a powerful tool for building search applications.

      Solr supports several query parsers, offering search application designers great flexibility in controlling how queries are parsed.

      This section explains how to specify the query parser to be used. It also describes the syntax and features supported by the main query parsers included with Solr and describes some other parsers that may be useful for particular situations. There are some query parameters common to all Solr parsers.

            The router name that will be used. The router defines how documents will be distributed among the shards. Possible values are implicit or compositeId.

            The implicit router does not automatically route documents to different shards. Whichever shard you indicate on the indexing request (or within each document) will be used as the destination for those documents.
            
            The compositeId router hashes the value in the uniqueKey field and looks up that hash in the collection’s clusterstate to determine which shard will receive the document, with the additional ability to manually direct the routing.
            
            When using the implicit router, the shards parameter is required. When using the compositeId router, the numShards parameter is required.

          description: |
            When creating collections, the shards and/or replicas are spread across all available (i.e., live) nodes, and two replicas of the same shard will never be on the same node.

            If a node is not live when the CREATE action is called, it will not get any parts of the new collection, which could lead to too many replicas being created on a single live node. Defining maxShardsPerNode sets a limit on the number of replicas the CREATE action will spread to each node.
            
            If the entire collection can not be fit into the live nodes, no collection will be created at all. The default maxShardsPerNode value is 1. A value of -1 means unlimited. If a policy is also specified then the stricter of maxShardsPerNode and policy rules apply.

            If not provided, the CREATE operation will create shard-replicas spread across all live Solr nodes.
            
            Alternatively, use the special value of EMPTY to initially create no shard-replica within the new collection and then later use the ADDREPLICA operation to add shard-replicas when and where required.

            A false value makes the results of a collection creation predictable and gives more exact control over the location of the individual shard-replicas, but true can be a better choice for ensuring replicas are distributed evenly across nodes. The default is true.

        Renaming a collection sets up a standard alias that points to the underlying collection, so that the same (unmodified) collection can now be referred to in query, index and admin operations using the new name.

        This command does NOT actually rename the underlying Solr collection - it sets up a new one-to-one alias using the new name, or renames the existing alias so that it uses the new name, while still referring to the same underlying Solr collection. However, from the user’s point of view the collection can now be accessed using the new name, and the new name can be also referred to in other aliases.
        
        The following limitations apply:
        
        the existing name must be either a SolrCloud collection or a standard alias referring to a single collection. Aliases that refer to more than 1 collection are not supported.
        
        the existing name must not be a Routed Alias.
