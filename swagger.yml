  description: |-
    Solr is an open-source search platform that allows you to easily create and manage search applications. It is built on top of Apache Lucene, a powerful and high-performance Java search engine library.

    Solr 8.11 provides a RESTful API that allows developers to interact with Solr using standard HTTP requests. One way to interact with the Solr API is through Swagger UI, a graphical interface that allows you to explore and test the Solr API.
    
    The Solr 8.11 Swagger API provides documentation for the Solr REST API, allowing developers to easily understand and use the API. The API is organized by resource and method, and each resource and method is described with detailed documentation, including input parameters, output formats, and examples.
    
    With the Solr 8.11 Swagger API, developers can quickly build powerful search applications that can search, index, and analyze large amounts of data with ease. The API also provides advanced features such as faceting, highlighting, and spatial search, making it a powerful tool for building search applications.

          description: |
            The router name that will be used. The router defines how documents will be distributed among the shards. Possible values are implicit or compositeId.

            The implicit router does not automatically route documents to different shards. Whichever shard you indicate on the indexing request (or within each document) will be used as the destination for those documents.
            
            The compositeId router hashes the value in the uniqueKey field and looks up that hash in the collection’s clusterstate to determine which shard will receive the document, with the additional ability to manually direct the routing.
            
            When using the implicit router, the shards parameter is required. When using the compositeId router, the numShards parameter is required.

          description: |
            When creating collections, the shards and/or replicas are spread across all available (i.e., live) nodes, and two replicas of the same shard will never be on the same node.

            If a node is not live when the CREATE action is called, it will not get any parts of the new collection, which could lead to too many replicas being created on a single live node. Defining maxShardsPerNode sets a limit on the number of replicas the CREATE action will spread to each node.
            
            If the entire collection can not be fit into the live nodes, no collection will be created at all. The default maxShardsPerNode value is 1. A value of -1 means unlimited. If a policy is also specified then the stricter of maxShardsPerNode and policy rules apply.

            If not provided, the CREATE operation will create shard-replicas spread across all live Solr nodes.
            
            Alternatively, use the special value of EMPTY to initially create no shard-replica within the new collection and then later use the ADDREPLICA operation to add shard-replicas when and where required.

            A false value makes the results of a collection creation predictable and gives more exact control over the location of the individual shard-replicas, but true can be a better choice for ensuring replicas are distributed evenly across nodes. The default is true.
            
            This parameter is ignored if createNodeSet is not also specified.

When such a collection is deleted, its autocreated configset will be deleted by default when it is not in use by any other collection.
